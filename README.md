# Pochoclo Games

We are **Pochoclo Games**, and we are studying at the University of Rafaela in Argentina. Our team consists of four members:

- **Gandini, Joaqu√≠n**: Programmer & Designer
- **Rosso, Carolina**: Artist & Designer
- **Moreira, Sebastian**: Sound Designer
- **Andereggen, Lucas**: Orchestra & Designer

## Game Proposals

We propose two games: one 1vs1 and one Co-Op.

### 1vs1 Game

In this game, both players compete in three different phases:

1. Gathering
2. Shopping
3. Combat

### Co-Op Game

In cooperative play, players will deliver a certain number of popcorn orders.

Both games are set in a small cinema, featuring a futuristic style with retro elements, all depicted in pixel art.

## Team Philosophy

We are dedicated to:

- Implementing an architecture of Entities and Components in our code.
- Including SOLID principles in our programming.
- Programming sounds and FX, creating documents (GDD, PPTX).
